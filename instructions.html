    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
      <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
      <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PS</h2>
    <p>One player can play multiple times in a row or choose to take turns after each round</p>
        <p><strong>Have fun</strong></p>
